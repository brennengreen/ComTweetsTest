# Com Tweets Test

## Things To Do:

1. Create an element in index.pug that will contain all the tweets
	* Use appropriate sizing I'm thinking we should be able to display 15 tweets
	* Maybe look up similar examples
2. Integrate the javascript twitter api to load tweets on page load
3. Figure out how to update the page in real time nicely (should be done after first two)
4. Create an element that will EMBED the most relevant trending tweet
	* This element should have its own .pug file and then be included into index.pug
